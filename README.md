# Rest countries

## Features that are implemented:

- Fetch all countries
- Filter countries by region
- Search for a country
- View detailed country
- Navigate to bordering countries from detailed view
- Switch between light and dark mode

Some remarks and tasks that should be addressed next:

- Filtering by region and search don't work together
- Theme cannot be changed from country's detailed view
- Country's detailed view could do with a nicer design
- Search field disappears when shrinking screen
- Performance optimisations
